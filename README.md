# Smart Game Format Parser

A parser for Smart Game Format (SGF) files. These files are used to record
two-player board game results and are most well-known for recording games of
Go, although other board games such as Backgammon can be recorded in this
format.

This project utilizes the FastParse parser-combinator library for Scala
developed by Li Haoyi.
