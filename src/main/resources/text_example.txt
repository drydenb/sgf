this is a file to test out matching the Text and SimpleText types in SGF files.

right bracket, colon, and backslash must be escaped with a backslash such as\:

\:, \], \\

the following backslash-newline combinations should be replaced with spaces \
\
\
\
the rest of the newlines should stay where they are.
let's test out some weird characters like #$%^ or !~~~//////// ++++.

Let's make sure we preserve other values that are escaped\: \5, \10, \^.

also, all tabs and other whitespace other than line breaks are converted to \
spaces
so the following					should all become spaces
